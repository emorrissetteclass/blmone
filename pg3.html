<p>On May 17th, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation is unconstitutional. While legislation was put into effect, this country was far from true equality.
In 1957, the U.S. Army was deployed to Little Rock Central High School to escort the Little Rock Nine, nine African-American students, to their high school so 
that they would not be hurt or killed on their way to school. They had already been confronted by an angry white mob and over 270 members of the Arkansas National Guard
sent there by the govenor of Arkansas in protest to the decisions made to end segregation.</p>
<p>It took 18 days, but a federal judge ordered the Arkansas National Guard to be removed. The first day the Little Rock Nine entered Central High, they were only
able to attend about three hours of classes before school officials sent them home, fearing for the lives of the students. For the rest of the year, they would be escorted
to their high school classes surrounded by guns and the faces of those who hated them. On May 27th, 1958, Ernest Green became the first African-American to graduate from
Central High.</p> 
<p>Two years later, Ruby Bridges, a 6 year old, is escorted by four federal marshalls to her elementary school in New Orleans. She was taught in an empty room by her 
teacher for a year. </p>
<p>The bravery of the Little Rock Nine and Ruby Bridges is a tiny sampling of what fighting for civil rights looked like at its peak. To be dealing with something like 
desegregation, alone, and at such a young age is a truely admirable contribution to the Civil Rights movement. Imagine being one of the Little Rock Nine. Picture walking 
towards a school where an angry mob seethes outside the front door of a high school like hot oil boiling. Imagne being Ruby Bridges, shadowed by picket signs with racist
slogans and angry faces of grown adults screaming down at her. The stress of dealing with something as disgusting as racism did not stop those powerful students from getting
their education or from silently and elegantly defying segregation.</p>
